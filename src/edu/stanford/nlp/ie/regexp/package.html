A couple of classes for regular expression based pattern
      matching and regular expression. 
There isn't much here: what's here provides extractors that match single
      level regular 
      expressions, as defined by a standard Perl-style regular
      expression pattern, and builds serialized versions of such
      extractors which interface with the KAON-based general IE
      functionality.

<i>Notes:</i> The current implementation is a bit inconsistent, in that
      the <code>RegexpExtractor</code> uses the JDK 1.4 regexp package,
      while the <code>RegexpsExtractor</code> uses Jakarta ORO.  As well
      as allowing multiple regular expressions, the latter has a bit of
      additional functionality.
