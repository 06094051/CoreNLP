<p>Math extensions for Matrix Toolkits for Java and Fastutil. As of 2008,
MTJ is the best matrix library for Java in terms of both completeness
and implementation runtime performance.  This package contains additional
data structures backed by Fastutil for use with MTJ, as well as some
math routines for use directly on fastutil collections.</p>

<p>
Note 2010: The above may have been true in 2008, but I 
don't think it's true now.  See for instance:
http://code.google.com/p/java-matrix-benchmark/ .
In general, maybe EJML is best, but at any rate, often any of EJML,
UJMP-J or ojAlgo seem to outperform MTJ.  CDM.
