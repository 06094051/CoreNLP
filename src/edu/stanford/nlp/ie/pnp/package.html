Character-based classifier and generator for proper noun phrases (PNPs).
PNPs are essentially named-entities (e.g. company names, people names, 
place names, etc.) {@link edu.stanford.nlp.ie.pnp.PnpClassifier PnpClassifier}
learns a generative model of PNPs from training data (lists of PNPs for each
category), which can be used both to classify unknown PNPs and to generate
novel PNPs. {@link edu.stanford.nlp.ie.pnp.PnpGenerator PnpGenerator} uses a
PnpClassifier to generate new PNPs after being trained on some example.
The other files are for generating data splits and test files, for assessing
the accuracy of humans at the task of PNP classification, and for visualizing
confusion matrices.
<p>The data files used for PnpClassifier are on the nlp machines in 
<tt>/u/nlp/data/pnp</tt>.</p>
