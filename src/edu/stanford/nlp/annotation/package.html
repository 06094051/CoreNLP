<p>
A simple markup annotator, originally designed for producing training
data for supervised information extraction systems.  The main class for
      doing this is <code>Annotator</code>.
</p>
<p>This package currently also contains a couple of tokenizers.  They
      should probably really live somewhere else.

<pre>
Annotator 1.3.1.
A simple Java editor that supports the easy addition of xml-style tags to
mark off portions of text.  It displays the tagging via color-coded regions.
This tool is designed for tagging training data for input to information
extraction models.

Usage: <code>java edu.stanford.nlp.annotation.Annotator [tagsFileName]</code>

The optional tags file will contain a list of tag names on separate lines,
and can be created from within Annotator.


Changes in 1.3.1 - 11/2/02
-------------
Made program more suitable for external calling, by moving the 
WindowListener setup into the constructor.
Cleaned the external API.

Changes in 1.3 - 8/29/01
-------------
Changed the name of the application from Tagger to Annotator.

New feature that automatically grays out non-essential html, and gives the
option to un-gray it.

More intelligent "Save changes first" scheme.

Made the tag toolbar immobile.

Opening a file starts the editor at the top of the file, rather than at the
bottom as before.

Known bug: color changing dialog doesn't distinguish between ok/cancel
Known limitations: no undo, mildly unintuitive save tag file scheme;
		   add option of interpreting a document using a normal
		   html tag scheme, as well as the xml one



Changes in 1.2 - 8/3/01
-------------
Added warnings for questionable tagging activity (ie, tagging that splits
up an existing html tag).  Changed the tag nomenclature:

&lt;TAG name="xxxx" value="start"/&gt;

and

&lt;TAG name="xxxx" value="end"/&gt;



Changes in 1.11 - 8/1/01
-------------
Dealt with nested tags -- outer-most tag defines the color that the text
is, regardless of the other start/end tags nested in the block.


Changes in 1.1 - 7/25/01
-------------
Added the option to change the color of tags
